# A simple game of darts in Java


## 1: Background

I wrote this program in high school back in 2018 in CS class. The goal was to create a game using an old library that provides a window and a pen to draw. 

## 2: Notes

This project includes 2 versions, one is the original version that i used in class (943 lines) and one is an optimized version that i just edited using a better structure and fixing bugs and features (439 lines). My intention was not to create a perfect 
game, I was just having fun with it and seeing how far I could take a library that's not even intented for any kind of game.
