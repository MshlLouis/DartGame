# A simple game of darts in Java


## 1: Background

I wrote this program in high school back in 2018 in CS class. The goal was to create a game using an old library that provides a window and a pen to draw. 

## 2: Notes

This project includes 2 versions, one is the original version that i used in class (943 lines) and one is an optimized version that i just edited using a better structure and fixing bugs and features (434 lines). My intention was not to create a perfect 
game, I was just having fun with it and seeing how far I could take a library that's not even intented for any kind of game.

## 3: How To Play

When launching the game, you can choose how you wanna play the game. I left the original language in German so yeah good luck with that I guess.

1. Choose between Singleplayer and Multiplayer

2. Choose difficulty (hard makes everything a lot faster than easy)




If you chose Multiplayer, there are 2 additional options:




3. Choose the number of players

4. Set the amount of points to win (between 1 and 1000)

For Multiplayer the goal is to reach the amount of points specified, for Singleplayer the goal is to get as many points as possible (you lose once an arrow doesn't
hit any point).

Use mouse double click to fix the arrows position on screen
Use mouse single click to shoot the arrow in its pointing direction
